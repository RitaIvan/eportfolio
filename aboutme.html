<h1>Story about an International Student - Nata</h1>
<img src="images/Nato1.jpg" alt="This is Myself" width="300px"/>
<p>My name is Nata and I am an international student at BMCC. I moved to New York about a year ago and started a completely new chapter of my life. During this period, I have met many interesting people and made countless unforgettable memories. During my free time, I love meeting my friends and going for long walks. I enjoy Photography, especially Film Photography</p
